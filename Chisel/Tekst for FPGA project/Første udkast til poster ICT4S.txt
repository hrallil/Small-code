----- background ------


In this first study, the focus is on one sorting algorithm, 
later other sorting and seartch alogirthms will be investigated. 


----- aims/pupose ------

Heapsort can be described with the time complexity of O(n*log(n)),
which is a well understood and predictable complexity. 
The algorithm also runs in asymptotic time complexity, 
making the complexity independant of input and other potentially dynamic data.
Heapsort also allows for certain degrees of paralleling in the implimentation, 
allowing for the investigation of the effects paralel programming
can have on resource and energy consumtion. Finally, the implimentation of Heapsort 
does not require more than a constant memory complexity, removing any redundant energy use.
